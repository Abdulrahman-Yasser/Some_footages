-  The only thing that should enter Gaza as long as Hamas doesn't release the hostages it holds is not a gram of humanitarian aid, but hundreds of tons of explosives from the Air Force. 

-  We don't leave the city centers in Gaza, that is the first thing ... The second thing, I suggest, and I say this in the most explicit way ... occupy Gaza and stay there ... what can and should be done is voluntary migration plan. A plan of encouragement, that will allow them to leave ... If we decide to [to expel Palestinians from Gaza], we can do it. https://twitter.com/MiddleEastEye/status/1747967081541255628

- We cut the supply of energy, water and diesel to the Strip ... But it’s not enough. In order to make the siege effective, we have to prevent others from giving assistance to Gaza ... The people should be told that they have two choices: to stay and to starve, or to leave. If Egypt and other countries prefer that these people will perish in Gaza, this is their choice. Eiland, Giora
Reservist Major General

-  Nakba to the enemy now! This day is our Pearl Harbor. We will still learn the lessons. Right now, one goal: Nakba! A Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of 48. A Nakba in Gaza and a Nakba for anyone who dares to join! Kallner, Ariel

-  This attack is not enough, there should be more, there should be no limits to the response, I said it a million times, until we see hundreds of thousands fleeing Gaza, we, the IDF has not achieved its mission, this is a phase that should happen, I am saying this cause these are instructions that were said to the IDF [...] I also do not want the IDF to get inside Gaza before crushing everything, I’d rather the falling of fifty buildings than one more casualty to our forces.

Minister of Foreign Affairs, MK (Likud)

-  All the civilian population in gaza is ordered to leave immediately. We will win. They will not receive a drop of water or a single battery until they leave the world. Katz, Israel

Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem

- The north of the Gaza Strip, more beautiful than ever. Everything is blown up and flattened, simply a pleasure for the eyes ... We must talk about the day after.

Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development


-  1. Annexing Area C is necessary, because if not, everything that happened to us in the Gaza envelope will happen to us in Kfar Saba, Herzliya, Ra'anana, and more. It's just a matter of time. 
    2. Annexing the northern Strip of Gaza is necessary, because if not, the residents of the Gaza envelope are again in existential danger. 
    3. We lost our reading of the security map since we called settlement 'settlement', since we called the pioneers 'hilltop youth'. It's important to note that the value of land is not only biblical but also grants us geopolitical depth and a grip on the territory which allows us to ensure our right to exist. We must return to the roots; the Maccabees, of blessed memory.

Former Minister of Interior, Minister of Justice (Jewish Home, New Right)

Director of the Metula Council

- We'd like to see, and we've talked about this in government meetings, by the way. There aren't any countries that want to take them [Gazans], even if we pay a lot of money.

- 

-  What does it mean to harm all the population? There are no innocents! That's exactly it. You're saying now 'population'! There is no population! There are two and a half million terrorist- therefore, warning before bombing is meaningless. Warning has to be for innocents only and since there's no innocent, so, there's no problem. When I said 'they are all terrorists [Interviewer: "What does it mean? Kill everybody?"] This is the perception, that there is something defined in times of war called 'The hour of grace.' Yosian, Eliyau
IDF Military Intelligence Unit 8200, awarded the Israel Defence Prize

-  On the first night, we should have taken down 50,000 Gazans, as a blood revenge. Cabinet discussions later, humanitarian later, prisoners and missing persons later. The first check - blood revenge. This is what Ben Gurion knew. Yosian, Eliyau

-  Hamas is not the enemy, but Gaza is the enemy. [...] It is not important who you warn, or who evacuates a neighborhood. This is what is called flattening the area, leveling the ground. You ask me what I would do? The answer is simply leveling the ground, and to kill the largest number possible. Because the woman is an enemy, the baby is an enemy, and the first grader is an enemy. The Hamas militant is an enemy and the pregnant woman is an enemy. We see it with our own eyes. Yossian, Eliyahu
Israeli TV analyst, Former military officer

Stop the war.

  - "The court orders came in the context of the “genocide case” against the government of Israel at the ICJ, an independent court based in The Hague. In December, South Africa’s government filed the case, alleging that, in the wake of the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on Israeli civilians, Israel has committed atrocities against the Palestinian people that  violate the 1948 Genocide Convention.<br>
  - Obligations to civilians are nonreciprocal. The fact that Hamas-led fighters committed war crimes against Israeli civilians – does not justify Israeli war crimes against Palestinian civilians.<br>
  - International humanitarian law is clear here: an occupying power is responsible for the wellbeing of an occupied population
"

- human right watch article :
  - Human Rights Watch has found that Israel is not complying with at least one of the binding provisional measures issued by the International Court of Justice in the genocide case brought by South Africa. States should use all forms of leverage, including targeted sanctions and an arms embargo, to press the Israeli government to comply with the binding order and to press the Israeli government and Palestinian armed groups to end unlawful attacks and other grave abuses. The lives of millions of civilians hang in the balance.

  - ”About one in every 20 children, women and men in #Gaza are now dead or wounded. 
  𝙏𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙞𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙧𝙣𝙖𝙜𝙚 .” 
  - Since early October, over 100,000 people have been killed or wounded. Let me repeat that: about one in every 20 children, women, and men, are now dead or wounded. 
  - At least 17,000 children are orphaned or separated from their families, while many more will carry the scars of physical and emotional trauma life-long. Today, the total number of people killed has exceeded 30,000. And tens of thousands of people are missing, many presumed buried under the rubble of their homes. 
  - the unprecedented level of killing and maiming of civilians in Gaza, including UN staff and journalists; the catastrophic humanitarian crisis caused by restrictions on humanitarian aid; the displacement of at least three-quarters of the population, often multiple times; the massive destruction of hospitals and other civilian infrastructure – and in many cases, systematic demolition of entire neighbourhoods, rendering Gaza largely unliveable.
  - Report A/HRC/55/28, which is before you, makes for very painful reading. Thousands of tonnes of munitions have been dropped by Israel on Gaza, including repeated use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects. These weapons send out a massive blast wave of high pressure that may rupture internal organs, as well as fragmentation projectiles, and heat so intense that it causes deep burns – and they have been used in densely populated residential neighbourhoods. In Egypt's El-Arish hospital, last November, I saw children whose flesh had been seared. I will never forget this. 
  - Over the past five months of warfare, the Office has recorded many incidents that may amount to war crimes by Israeli forces, as well as indications that Israeli forces have engaged in indiscriminate or disproportionate targeting that violates international humanitarian law.

- February registered a 50% reduction of humanitarian aid entering #Gaza compared to January.
Aid was supposed to increase not decrease to address the huge needs of 2 million Palestinians in desperate living conditions. Among the obstacles: lack of political will, regular closing of the crossing points & lack of security due to military operations + collapse of civil order.
Cease fire + lifting the siege to allow meaningful lifesaving aid + commercial supplies are long overdue. https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1762065832417325441?s=20

  - In the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Israeli forces’ use of airstrikes, attack helicopters, anti-tank missiles, shoulder-fired explosive projectiles and other weapons of war , has continued to increase, with lethal results, including killings of children. The report also notes a growing pattern of Israeli forces preventing paramedics from reaching Palestinians, including children, who have been injured in such operations. 

  - From 1 January to 6 October, last year had already seen the highest levels of violence by Israeli military personnel and settlers against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since United Nations records began in 2005. From 7 October last year to 23 February this year, at least 401 Palestinians in the West Bank were killed, 102 of them children. The vast majority of cases that the Office has monitored raise concerns of unlawful killings, including extra-judicial killings.
